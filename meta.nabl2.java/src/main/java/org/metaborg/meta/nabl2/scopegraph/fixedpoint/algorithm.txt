=== fixed point path generation ===

on new step s1 -l-> s2:
  new path s1 ->> s2
  for every path s0 ->> s1:
    new path s0 ->> s2
    for every path s1 ->> s2:
      new path s1 ->> s2
      new path s0 ->> s2

on new path s1 ->> s2:
  for every x_i -> s1:
    for every s2 -> x_j:
      new path x_i |-> x_j
      
on new path x_i |-> x_j:
  for every s1 =l=> x_i:
    for every x_j =l=> s2:
      new step s1 -l-> s2

=== path resolving ===

paths can be added, and later removed

I think that a path that is removed will never be added again,
so there is no need to keep a set of deleted paths

we need to be careful about paths that are currently in the queue
if part of that path is an import path that gets removed, we should not
accidently keep that path around
- actually, if we want to have ESOP behaviour, we may want different behaviour
