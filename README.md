# NaBL: A Meta-Language for Declarative Name Binding and Scope Rules

In Spoofax, name bindings are specified in NaBL.
NaBL stands for *Name Binding Language* and the acronym is pronounced 'enable'.
Name binding is specified in terms of
  namespaces, 
  binding instances (name declarations), 
  bound instances (name references),
  scopes and
  imports.
